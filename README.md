# World_Weather_Analysis
Module six
The main goal in this module is to learn how use data from APIs (Application Program Interface) to retrieve data from some Web Services like Google Maps and others in order to be processed and analyzed. APIs returned data in different formats but one of the most important is JASON (JavaScrip Object Notation), which has been used a lot on this project.

In this project, the main purpose was to make several changes to the code we wrote during lessons review in order to filter data recovered from some cities, their coordinates, their weather and other information to identify travel destinations, itineraries, hotels to be used for potential customers to plan their vacation.

Finally, a travel itinerary and a marker layer map between four identified cities were created using Google Maps Directions API
